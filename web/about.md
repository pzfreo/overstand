# **Overstand**

Version: {{version}}

A tool for designing and calculating precise neck geometry for arched stringed instruments including violins, viols, guitars, and mandolins.

The string length, neck angle, bridge position, bridge height, nut position, fingerboard shape and overstand are all linked in a flexible geometry. This app is designed to help explore this as you design new instruments or tweak existing designs. The app calculates neck angle and draws a diagram based on your measurements. You can download the diagram as a scale accurate PDF for printing.

There are two main approaches:  
• For violins and viols, the string length and body stop (along with other parameters) are used to calculate the neck angle and neck stop. If you have an alternative (e.g. calculate the string length based on body stop and neck stop) let me know and I can implement it.  
• For guitars and mandolins, the body stop is calculated based on which fret the body join is at, usually 12 or 14. 

This tool is in development and not to be relied on with your precious luthiery project. Please double check anything it tells you\!

I'd love feedback \- [paul@fremantle.org](mailto:paul@fremantle.org) 

Also if you want to submit an instrument measurements I'm planning a database: please save the data and send me the .json file.

Built with Python (Pyodide), JavaScript, and SVG
